All of the code in this directory are realized SVM algorithom.I wirited these in my graduation design that is namedresearch of a DNA sequence classification method based on support vector machine.

use feature.py to generate feature data from DNA sequence,./feature.py -h for help

use scale.py to scale the data of feature for svm train data,./scale.py -h for help

use train.py to train data which has been scaled,./train.py for help

use predict.py to predict known or unknoen data which has be scaled,./predict.py for help
